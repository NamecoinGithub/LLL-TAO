# LedgerDB hash-keyed block reads

`LedgerDB::ReadBlock(hash, BlockState&)` and `LedgerDB::ReadBlock(hash, atomic&)` both check the loaded record before publishing it to the caller. A mismatch returns false and leaves the caller's output unchanged.

Client mode uses `ClientDB` and still applies the same identity check. The non-client path uses the ledger sector record. Callers no longer have to repeat this comparison for these two hash-keyed reads.

Production bucket counts must match the on-disk keychain. `LLD::Initialize` opens client-mode `LedgerDB` with 77773 buckets and non-client `LedgerDB` with `256 * 256 * 64`. `ClientDB` is separate and is opened with 1000000 buckets. A test that creates `ClientDB` must use that production count, and it must restore or erase only the record it wrote.
